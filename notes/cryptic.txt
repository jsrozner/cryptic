2.7 over 3.3 because of nltk support

smart: add to dictionary of possible change words, e.g.

QUESTIONS
	- semantic concerns

BASIC
	- flags
		- depth of similarity search
		- should remove indicator
		- UK / US
		- require "!", "?" indicators, i.e. try full definition for "!"

	- code. requires clue and length (in parens), new line

GENERAL
	- search for meanings on either side of clue

NEED
	- indicate probable definition side (or just execute over both)

SIMPLICATIONS
	- single first leter
	- rearrangements (anagram indicator)
	- remove (apostrophe s), other punctuation
	- find synonyms

DICTIONARIES
	- map words / phrases to
		1) anagram clues (simple words)
		2) positional words (could be an anagram)
			- charade positionals
		3) container words
		4) deletion / subtraction words (note deletion position)

	- phrase lookup?

SCORES
	- indicator at begin or end => defition at opposite end

REPRESENTATIONS
	- input clue mapped to word array
	- transform to object
		- word array
		- notes
	- parse out indicators and add to notes
		- execute synonym searches to yield a term array, where each term has many things
	- keep full string less punctuation for hidden search
	- possible solutions with scores

ANAGRAMS (2)
	- dict: change words (dynamically modify this)
		- machine learn based on frequency of correctness

	- more complex
		- indirect anagrams (clue => new word => anagram)
		- abbreviated / single letters

	- ideas:
		1) does anagram cluing word exist?
		2) remove that word
		3) parse a definition, rearrange words
		4) see if any defiitons correspond to anagrams

CHARADE (3-4)
	- dict: charade positionals

	- more complex: single letters

	- ideas:
		1) look for positional indicator, remove if exists
		2) try near synonyms
		3) combine valid numerical combos
		4) see if any are words
		5) see if any are defined as remaining words

CONTAINERS (3-4)
	- dict: container indicators

	- more complex: single letters

	ideas:
		1) look for container indicators, remove if exists
		2) try lookup
		3) try container substitution (or just do an anagram iteration)
		4) look for definition match

DELETIONS (4)
	- dict: deletion indicators

	- ideas:
		1) look for indicator, remove
		2) get synonyms
		3) apply subtraction
		4) check matches

DOUBLE DEF (1-2)
	- lack indicators (except maybe "or")

HIDDEN (1-2)
	- dict: hidden indicators

	- ideas:
		1) simple lengthwise pass through clue
		2) parse out indicator words

	- complex:
		1) first letters
		2) capitalization as indicator
		3) multiple indicators
		4) odd letters

HOMOPHONES (1-2)
	- dict: homophones, homophone indicators

	- ideas: 
		1) parse indicator
		2) synonyms
		3) homophone indicated word
		4) check def

	- more complex: middle words (take longer one)

REVERSALS (1-2)
	dict: reversal indicators

	- ideas: parse indicators
		2) synonyms
		3) reverse
		4) check

CRYPTIC (4-5)
	see examples
	sometimes denoted by question mark

SPOONERISMS (4)
	spooner indicators

	1) spooner indicaotr
	2) synonyms
	3) swap consonants/ syllables

&LIT (4)
	indicators: "!"

	def is whole clue
